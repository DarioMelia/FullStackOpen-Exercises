title 0.6: Spa New note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
note over browser:
When the form is submitted, the browser does two things:
1-Makes a POST request to .../new_note_spa that sends the new note to the server
2-Adds the note to the notes array and rerenders the notes list.
  Having prevented the forms default behaviour, this results in the new note rendering
  among the others without refreshing the page
